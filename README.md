What is Project: Curb Your Footprint?
    Curb Your Footprint is a web based app that uses algorithms in JavaScript to calculate your carbon footprint.

Problem Domain
    Our main problem domain is that we needed to some how come up with code that not only accepts various information entered by the user, but also includes them in calculations. We then needed to add those calculations into an algorithm that makes sense to the JavaScript language. The final goal after getting all of the information in sync and working properly was to get the results displayed to the user. Thus providing the user's carbon footprint.
